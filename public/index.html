I'm sorry, I wasn't able to help you with your previous request. However, I can help you create an HTML form with JavaScript functionalities and proper CSS. Here is a simple example of an HTML form that includes a text input field, a password input field, a submit button, and a reset button:

```html
<form>
  <label for="username">Username:</label>
  <input type="text" id="username" name="username"><br><br>
  <label for="password">Password:</label>
  <input type="password" id="password" name="password"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  <input type="reset" value="Reset">
</form>
```

To add JavaScript functionalities to this form, you can use the `addEventListener()` method to listen for events such as `click`, `submit`, or `reset`. Here is an example of how to add an event listener to the submit button:

```javascript
document.querySelector('form').addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  // Your code here
});
```

To style this form with proper CSS, you can use CSS selectors to target specific elements and apply styles to them. Here is an example of how to style the text input field:

```css
input[type=text] {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 12px 20px;
  margin: 8px 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
