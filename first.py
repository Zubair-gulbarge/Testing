# Example: Click on the first search result link (coordinates may need adjustment)
# pyautogui.click(x=200, y=200)

# Close the web browser (adjust the coordinates to your browser's close button)

# Perform a right-click
pyautogui.click(button='right')

# Close the application
pyautogui.hotkey('alt', 'f4')

# Note: Be cautious when using automation, and always respect the terms of service of the application you are automating.
