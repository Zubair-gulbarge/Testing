# Problem: Implement Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a Graph
# Description: Implement the breadth-first search algorithm on a graph.
# Code:

# from collections import deque
# def bfs(graph, start):
#     visited = set()
#     queue = deque([start])
#     visited.add(start)
#     while queue:
#         node = queue.popleft()
#         print(node)
#         for neighbor in graph[node]:
#             if neighbor not in visited:
#                 visited.add(neighbor)
#                 queue.append(neighbor)

# Problem: Check for Bipartite Graph
# Description: Determine whether a given graph is bipartite or not.
# Code:

# def is_bipartite(graph, start):
#     color = {}
#     queue = [start]
#     color[start] = 0
#     while queue:
#         node = queue.pop(0)
#         for neighbor in graph[node]:
#             if neighbor not in color:
#                 color[neighbor] = 1 - color[node]
#                 queue.append(neighbor)
#             elif color[neighbor] == color[node]:
#                 return False
#     return True

# Problem: Implement Depth-Limited Search (DLS)
# Description: Implement the depth-limited search algorithm.
# Code:

def dls(graph, start, depth, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    if depth <= 0:
        return
    visited.add(start)
    print(start)
    for next_node in graph[start] - visited:
        dls(graph, next_node, depth - 1, visited)

# Problem: Implement Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
# Description: Implement the uniform cost search algorithm on a weighted graph.
# Code:

# import heapq
# def ucs(graph, start):
#     visited = set()
#     heap = [(0, start)]
#     while heap:
#         cost, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
#         if node not in visited:
#             visited.add(node)
#             print(node)
#             for neighbor, weight in graph[node].items():
#                 if neighbor not in visited:
#                     heapq.heappush(heap, (cost + weight, neighbor))
