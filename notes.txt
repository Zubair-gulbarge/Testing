**3. Functions and Modules:**
   - Explore how to define and use functions.
   - Learn about Python modules and how to import them.

**4. Data Structures:**
   - Understand lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
   - Learn how to manipulate data within these structures.

**5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
   - Study the principles of OOP, including classes and objects.
   - Explore inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

**6. Exception Handling:**
   - Learn how to handle errors and exceptions gracefully using try-except blocks.

**7. File Handling:**
   - Understand how to read from and write to files.

**8. Python Standard Library:**
   - Familiarize yourself with Python's extensive standard library, which includes modules for various purposes.

**9. Python Web Development:**
   - Start with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a foundation for web development.
   - Study web frameworks like Django or Flask to build web applications.

**10. Databases:**
    - Learn about databases and use libraries like SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL for data storage and retrieval.

**11. APIs and RESTful Services:**
    - Learn how to work with APIs and consume data from web services.

**12. Data Analysis and Visualization:**
    - Study libraries like NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.
    - Learn data visualization using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

**13. Machine Learning and Data Science (Optional):**
    - Explore machine learning using libraries like Scikit-Learn and deep learning with TensorFlow and Keras.

**14. Advanced Python Concepts (Optional):**
    - Study advanced topics like decorators, generators, and metaclasses.

**15. Projects and Practice:**
    - Apply your knowledge by working on Python projects. Start with simple projects and gradually move to more complex ones.
    - Contribute to open-source Python projects on platforms like GitHub.

**16. Debugging and Testing:**
