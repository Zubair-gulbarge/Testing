# Problem: Implement Binary Search
# Description: Implement the binary search algorithm to find the index of a target element in a sorted array.
# Code:

# def binary_search(nums, target):
#     left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
#     while left <= right:
#         mid = left + (right - left) // 2
#         if nums[mid] == target:
#             return mid
#         elif nums[mid] < target:
#             left = mid + 1
#         else:
#             right = mid - 1
#     return -1
